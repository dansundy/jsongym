# JSON Gym

Write custom workouts in `JSON` (JavaScript Object Notation).

## Getting Started

JSON Gym leads you through customized workouts â€“ telling you what exercise to do next and timing exercises and rest times. Go to [jsongym.com](http://jsongym.com) to check it out.

## Example

A very simple workout would look something like this:


    {
        "name": "Example Workout",
        "description" : "The workout's description",
        "exercises": [
            {
            	"name": "The First Exercise",
            	"reps": 10,
       			  "rest": 30
      		  }
    	 ]
	 }
