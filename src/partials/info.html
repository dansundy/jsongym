        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      </header>
      <p>JSON Gym leads you through customized workouts â€“ telling you what exercise to do next and timing exercises and rest times. To get started:
        <ol>
          <li>Create a file with a .json extension. <em>(eg. my-first-workout.json)</em>.</li>
          <li>Write a workout in valid JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) according to the API below.
            <ul>
              <li>Note: If you don't have any experience with writing <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> you can have a look at <a href="http://www.json.com">json.com</a> or just adjust one of the examples below.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Add your workout on the <a href="#/add">Add Workout</a> page. You can add in two ways. The first, submit a readable link to the .json file. If you have a server you could point it there or you could use a local file url <em>(ie. file:///)</em>. The second option is to add your file via Dropbox.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>One quick note: there is no need to log in. Your workouts are stored right on your device. This means that they will be there as long as your browser cache isn't cleared. If you do clear your cache, simply re-add your workouts.</p>

        <h2>API</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Workouts are written in valid JSON format. A very simple workout would look something like this:</p>
      
        <code>
<pre>
{
  "name": "Example Workout",
  "description" : "The workout's description",
  "cycles": 2,
  "exercises": [
    {
      "name": "Pushups",
      "reps": 10,
      "rest": 30
    },
    {
      "name": "Plank",
      "time": 15,
      "rest": 30
    }
  ]
}</pre>
        </code>

      <p>The following is a list of options.</p>
      
      <h3>name (required)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Type: String</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The name of the workout as you would like it to appear in the application.</p>
      
      <h3>description</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Type: String</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>A description of the workout. If provided, this information will appear as a sub section of the workouts list.</p>
      
      <h3>order</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Type: Integer</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Forces the order of appearance in the list of workouts. If the order is not explicitly set, workouts will appear with the most recently modified file first. If timestamps are all the same (e.g. if all files are uploaded at the same time), they will appear in alphabetical order by name.</p>
      
      <h3>cycles</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Type: Integer</li>
        <li>Default: 1</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The number of times to go through the list of excercises.</p>
      
      <h3>autoStart</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Type: Boolean</li>
        <li>Default: false</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Set whether or not timed exercises should start automatically.</p>
      
      <h3>autoNext</h3>

        <li>Type: Boolean</li>
        <li>Default: true</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Set whether or not timed exercises should move on to rest time or the next exercise automatically.</p>

        <li>Type: Array</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>An array of objects that contains the information for each exercise in the workout.</p>
      
      <h3>exercises -> title (required)</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Type: String</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The name of the exercise as you would like to have it appear during the workout.</p>

      <h3>exercises -> rest</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Type: Integer</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The number of seconds of rest after the respective exercise. Rest time will not appear at the end of the last cycle.</p>
